AccessLand.org
==========================

This is the site for AccessLand.org.

It was forked from shutthebackdoor.net, with some pretty minor changes.

### Development
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `jekyll serve --watch` in terminal
- Go to http://localhost:4000

This is a GitHub Pages site - the active branch is `gh-pages`, not `master`.

All images are optimised for mobile, and javascript is minified. To do this, use the commands in the gulpfile.
